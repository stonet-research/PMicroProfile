This is GNU paxutils.
This document describes the actions needed to build the pre-release
or CVS version of the package. See end of file for copying conditions.

* Introduction

    This is a *pre-release* version, and not ready for production use
yet. For information about GNU paxutils and its aims, please see file
README.

    If you are taking source from CVS, you will need to have automake,
and autoconf installed to bootstrap the package. See the chapter
`Building' for the detailed instructions. After bootstrapping, there
should be a file 'INSTALL' with generic installation
instructions. Package-specific installation instructions are set forth
in the file README. 

    Please, note that the accompanying documentation may be inaccurate
or incomplete (well, to say the truth it is absent. See TODO for more
info). The ChangeLog file is currently the authoritative documentation
of all recent changes. 

Report bugs to <bug-tar@gnu.org>

* Checking Out the Sources

    The following instructions apply if you wish to obtain sources from
the CVS repository:

To checkout the source tree from CVS issue the following command:

CVS_RSH=ssh \
 cvs -d :ext:anoncvs@savannah.gnu.org:/cvsroot/paxutils checkout paxutils

Make sure SSHv2 is used.

This will give you read-only access.  If you think you need write access,
contact the mailing list.

The CVS repository is also available via HTTP from

    http://savannah.gnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/paxutils/paxutils

* Building

    In order to build this you will first need to have right versions
of autotools. At the time of this writing these are:

  Package   Version (>=)
  ========  ============
  automake  1.8.5
  autoconf  2.59
  gettext   0.14.1

    To prepare the package for building run build-aux/bootstrap. For
example:

 $ cd paxutils
 $ build-aux/bootstrap

    If you have already checked out gnulib sources, use --gnulib-srcdir
to specify their location, this will spare you time and bandwidth:

 $ cd paxutils
 $ build-aux/bootstrap --gnulib-srcdir=$HOME/gnu/gnulib
