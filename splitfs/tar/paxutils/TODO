This is the roadmap for GNU paxutils. The entries are in 'historical'
order, i.e. they must be executed from top to bottom. More entries
will be added soon.

* Move all project-independent parts of tar and cpio there and
update both projects to use these.

* Add general-purpose buffering functions for use by tar and cpio.

* Create libpaxutils.
